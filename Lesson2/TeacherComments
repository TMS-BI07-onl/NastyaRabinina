a) -0.5
Correct answer: ... WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%'. 
Should I treat commented part of the code as an alternative solution? 
Only the commented condition is correct.
e) -1
Expected answer:
SELECT  ProductSubcategoryID,
		MIN(Weight) AS Min_weight, 
		MAX(Size) AS Max_size
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ProductSubcategoryID
Color is not needed in the select list (and group by).
